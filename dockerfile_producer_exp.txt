

This is a Dockerfile that specifies the steps to build a Docker 
image for the producer microservice.

The FROM directive specifies the base image to use for the Docker image. In this case, 
the base image is python, 
which is a minimal Docker image that includes the Python runtime.

The RUN directive runs a command to create a new directory and install
 the pika and flask Python packages. The pika package is a client library for RabbitMQ, 
 and the flask package is a web framework for Python.

The ENV directive sets the environment variable FLASK_APP to producer.

The WORKDIR directive sets the current working directory for the
 subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile.

The COPY directive copies the producer.py file from the build context
 (the current directory) to the working directory in the image.

The CMD directive specifies the command to run when the container is started.
 In this case, the flask command is run with the run subcommand to start
  the Flask development server, listening on all interfaces (--host=0.0.0.0).
